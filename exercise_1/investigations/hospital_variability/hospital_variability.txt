In this section, we list the top 10 hospitals and explain the rationale behind our investigation.

Hospitals data has several sets of interesting information regarding hospital quality. This quality data can
grouped under three broad categories

1. HCAHPS scores - based on patient quality surveys
2. Readmissions quality socres
3. Effective care quality scores.

Each of these scores have different min/max values and different distributions. 

The HCAHPS scores are surveys
on different scales (1 to 9 OR 1 to 10 OR sometimes just a single numerical value). HCAHPS scores summaries
are captured in two values hcahps_base_score and hcahps_consistency_score that together capture the total
score for the patient quality experience.

Readmissions quality scores refer to the quality of readmissions and talk about the number of readmissions.
The lower the number the better.

Effective care refers to how effective the treatment of care has been. It captures the numbers of complications
resulting from existing treatments and so on.

Given the diverse nature of each of these different scores, this assignment normalizes all the scores on a scale
of 0 to 10 and uses this scale to compare performance.

Hospital variability shows the mean and variance among hospital quality
socres.

The results show that for 3037 hospitals that were examined, we have the
following results

1. Overall HCAHPS SCORE (Normalizes 0-10): There is mean score of 3.74 with a
rather high standard deviation of 2.08 with some hospitals as low as 0 and some as high
as 10.

2. Effective Care Score (Normalized 0-10): There is a mean effective care
score of 5.68 and standard devation of 1.57 with scores as low as 0 and as
high as 10. 

3. Readmissions Score (Normalized 0-10): There is a mean readmissions score of
6.62 and a standard deviation of 2.05 with scores as low as 0 and as high as
10. Note that the readmissions scores has been flipped to show higher values
indicating better scores and lower values indicating worser scores.
