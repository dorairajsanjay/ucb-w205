Hospital rating is viewed as a composite of
******************************************
    - total hcahps score
    - total readmissions score
    - total effective care score

- Achievement - My hospital current performance compared to all hospitals' baseline period performance.
- Improvement - My hospital's current performance compared to my baseline period performance.
- Two component - Clinicial Process Domain Score and Patient Experience Domain Score(70% + 30%) yields the total performance score.
- The survey responses are mainly focused on the Patient Experience Domain Score. It consists of HCAHPS base points and consistency points. (80% base score and 20% consistency)
- Computation of Patient Expereince of Care Domain Score
    - Greater of improvement or achievement points for each HCAHPS dimension plus consistency points - this is the base score.
    - Consistency points encourage hospitals to meet or exceed he Achievement Threshold in all HCAHPS dimensions and is calculated based on hospital performance in all dimensions relative to the achievement thresholds for that dimension.
    - Total score = base score + consistency points.
- It focuses on the following
    - Nurse communication
    - Doctor communication
    - Staff Responsibility
    - Pain management
    - Medicine Communication
    - Clean and Quiet
    - Discharge Information

readmissions
************
- Hospital compare (better, worse, same) is based on lower estimate of score.
- Lower is better for readmissions.
- measure start dates
    - 07/01/2011
    - 07/01/2013
- measure end dates
    - 06/30/2014
- Unique start date/end date combinations
    - 07/01/2011    06/30/2014 - 62205 non-unique hospitals
    - 07/01/2013    06/30/2014 - 4785 non-unique hospitals
- distinct providers/hospitals - 4785
- total records - 66990
- 14 measures for each hospital
