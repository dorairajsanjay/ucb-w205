CREATING A PERCENTAGE MEASURE:

STEP ONE: find the denominator

SELECT count(registrantid) as count_value_sum
FROM voter_grand

STEP TWO: wrap it & join it back to itself

SELECT *
FROM voter_grand a
JOIN
(SELECT count(registrantid) as count_value_sum
FROM voter_grand) b

STEP THREE: create the percentage calculation in SELECT
SELECT a.partycode, count(a.registrantid)/b.count_value_sum as percentage
FROM voter_grand a
JOIN 
(SELECT count(registrantid) as count_value_sum
FROM voter_grand) b
GROUP BY a.partycode, b.count_value_some

STEP FOUR: add a WHERE statement
SELECT a.partycode, count(a.registrantid)/b.count_value_sum as percentage
FROM voter_grand a
JOIN 
(SELECT count(registrantid) as count_value_sum
FROM voter_grand) b
WHERE a.partycode IN ("DEM", "GRN", "LIB", "REP") 
GROUP BY a.partycode, b.count_value_some
